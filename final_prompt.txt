You are responsible for finding missing docs.

Complete the following tasks:
1. Based on the modified requirements.txt create a clean virtual environment under .venv/. Ensure that:
 - Do not reuse any existing environment. 
 - If .venv/ already exists, delete and recreate it.
 - Install all dependencies into .venv/.
 - Generate or update .gitignore so that .venv/ will not be uploaded to Git.

2. You must generate a reference_link.txt file documenting all missing docs.
The file should follow the structure below:
(1) core/utils.py: Missing module docstring (line 1)
(2) services/payment.py: Missing function docstring for process_payment() (line 15)
(3) models/user.py: Missing class docstring for UserProfile (line 3)

3. Fill in all previously identified missing docs.
   Do not modify existing code or logic—only add the missing documentation.

4. Implement an automatic test execution script named auto_test.py that:
   - Detects the current environment (Windows/Linux/Docker)
   - Runs the corresponding test script (run_test.sh for Linux/macOS, run_test.bat for Windows)
   - Saves all output logs to logs/test_run.log
   - The log must include a timestamp and a final status line: TEST PASSED or TEST FAILED
   - These tests are intended to verify that all previously identified Missing docs (module, class, function docstrings) have been added.
